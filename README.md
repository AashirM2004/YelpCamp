# YelpCamp
YelpCamp is an online platform enabling users to both generate and evaluate campground listings. To either assess or produce a campground listing, it is a prerequisite to possess an active account.

The development of this project involved the utilization of Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap, with authentication management facilitated through Passport.js.
